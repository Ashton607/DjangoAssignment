<h1>Student Planning and Management System</h1>
<p>This project is a Django-based web application designed to help students manage their academic workload more effectively by improving time management, reducing procrastination, and increasing task visibility.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Many university students struggle with poor planning, forgotten deadlines, and last-minute cramming. This app was developed in response to research involving real student interviews, which revealed common challenges such as overwhelming workloads, ineffective reminder systems, and difficulty prioritizing.

The app helps students break down tasks, set deadlines, and stay on track with smart scheduling and a clean, intuitive interface. It was designed with a strong focus on user-centered design, usability, and simplicity, and built using Django as the backend framework. </p>
